British TV’s penchant for the weird is not just confined to adult shows either. Children’s television also used to nurture the stranger side of the British imagination, from the hand-knitted cosmic oddness of The Clangers to the megalithic occultism of Children of the Stones. Even shows of a less-fantastical ilk such as Brideshead Revisited and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy moved at an eerily glacial pace by today’s storytelling standards, which only enhanced the strange, aspic universes in which the aristocracy and cold war spycraft used to operate.
